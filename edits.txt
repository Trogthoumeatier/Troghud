Edits:

	First of all, 90% of this hud is hypnotize hud, the rest is parts from other huds listed in the README.md file and my own edits.
	
	General changes:
		
		I made the player model thing in the corner bigger same with the class image.
		I made the background image of the menu when you first start up the game a picture of space.
		Changed the text on the menu to le epik meems.
		Made the health / overheall cross thing visible. (from stabby hud)
		Took the loadout screen from ciba hud.
	
	Specific changes:
		
		Medic:
			
			Took the uber bar at the bottom of the screen from woolhud.
			
		Spy:
		
			Made the disguise thing that pops up on your screen when you disguise visible.
			Made the smaller image of the spy when you disguise with the player class model thing turned off bigger.
			
(If it's not mentioned here it's most likely from Hypnotize HUD)
